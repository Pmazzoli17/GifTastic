# GifTastic

An app that populates the page with gifs of your choice.  Created using JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML and calls the GIPHY API.

When you click on a button the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page. 

When you click one of the still GIPHY images, the gifs animate. If you click the gif again, then it stops playing.

Under every gif, the rating is displayed. 

If you enter a name in the Add a Villain input and click submit it will add another villain/button to the page.
